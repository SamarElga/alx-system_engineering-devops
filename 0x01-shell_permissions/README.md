*0x01. Shell, permissions*
this is project numer 22 in my ALX learning journey and its main objective is to explain to anyone without the help of google the following permissions: 
* 200~What do the commands chmod, sudo, su, chown, chgrp do 

* Linux file permissions 

* How to represent each of the three sets of permissions (owner, group, and other) as a single digit 

* How to change permissions, owner and group of a file 

* Why canâ€™t a normal user chown a file 

* How to run a command with root privileges 

* How to change user ID or become superuser
